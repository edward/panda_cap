This is basically a set of Capistrano commands that *should* set-up your server for Panda with MySql.

Note that this setup is intended for a 64-bit server instance. Should you
choose to use a 32-bit system, edit system.rb appropriately.

It's pretty messy but does work for myself, so it's not all bad.
